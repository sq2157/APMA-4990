# Data cleaning and preparation
-Combine tracks and echonest databases

-Extract year released from the track release date

-Select year with most songs, and genres with most songs within that year 

-Change the 'track_listens' variable into popular or not, in order to do classification

-Check for correlation between variables and scale data

# Modeling
-First use a baseline model, including genre as a variable and finding that genre is an important feature

-Split datasets by genre (three separate datasets for rock, hip-hop, and electronic for 2010)

-Test logistic regression with penalty (L1, L2), decision tree, random forest, and knn, using GridSearch to search over parameter values

-Compare AUC ROC on random subsets of data and for each genre select optimal model
